# Keylogging gifViewer
This program is a simple GUI that displays gifs from online. Within it, there is a hidden keylogger program. 
In this project, I gained experience with Python & C++ and learned about types of malware and how they are obscured from the user.
Key takeaways: caution when downloading unverified software, using a batch script to run the project, making a GUI and using HTTP requests. 

## Usage:
Requirements: Windows, Python, GCC
Simply run the gifViewer.bat file. All dependencies will automatically be installed.
