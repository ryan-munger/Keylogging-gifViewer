# kittylogger
This program is a simple GUI that displays gifs from online. Within it, there is a hidden keylogger program. 
In this project I gained experience with python & c++ and learned about types of malware and how they are obscured from the user.
Key takeaways: caution when downloading unverified software, using batch script to run project, making a GUI and using http requests.
