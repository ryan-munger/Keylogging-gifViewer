# Keylogging gifViewer
This program is a simple GUI that displays gifs from online. Within it, there is a hidden keylogger program. \
In this project, I gained experience with Python & C++ and learned about types of malware and how they are obscured from the user. \
Key takeaways: caution when downloading unverified software, using a batch script to run the project, making a GUI and using HTTP requests. 

## Usage:
Requirements: Windows, Python, Optional: GCC (if issues arise) -  [Install GCC Here](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2023-05-26/msys2-x86_64-20230526.exe). \
Simply run the gifViewer.bat file. All dependencies will automatically be installed. \
If there are issues with the .exe, recompile it by uncommenting the GCC line in the batch file.
